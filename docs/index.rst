DataStax Enterprise Python Driver
=================================
This is the documentation for the DataStax Enterprise Python Driver for DSE. This
driver is built on top of the `DataStax Python driver for Apache Cassandra <http://datastax.github.io/python-driver/index.html>`_
and enhanced for the adaptive data management and mixed workload capabilities provided by DSE. Therefore a lot of the
underlying concepts are the same. To keep this documentation focused we will be linking to the relevant sections
of the core where necessary.

Contents
--------
:doc:`installation`
    How to install the extension.

:doc:`getting_started`
    Covers upgrade from core driver, and first steps of connecting to DSE and executing queries.

:doc:`auth`

:doc:`geo_types`
